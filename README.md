## ✅ Features

- Real-time form validation (on blur event)
- Email format checking
- Password must contain:
  - At least 1 uppercase letter
  - At least 1 lowercase letter
  - At least 1 number
  - Minimum length (e.g., 8 characters)
- Dynamic error messages
- Fully responsive design
- No frameworks used — pure HTML, CSS & JS

## 🛠 How It Works

- When the user leaves an input field (loses focus), the script validates the content.
- If the input is invalid, an error message is shown.
- Once the user corrects the input, the error disappears in real-time.
